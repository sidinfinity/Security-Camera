# Second Milestone
My second milestone was finishing the AI model to detect faces and getting a livestream on the raspberrypi using the Picamera. I also added a keybind "p", which takes a picture and uploads it to nanonets for processing so I can draw the bounding boxes around the faces when I get a response.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was pre-processing my dataset and getting it ready for training. The dataset I used came with a text file that showed where to place the bounding boxes. I wrote a small script that loops through the annotations text file and generates a xml file in the xml directory. I also wrote a few tests to make sure my code works after I make changes.
