# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was finishing the AI model to detect faces and getting a livestream on the raspberrypi using the Picamera. I also added a keybind "p", which takes a picture and uploads it to nanonets for processing so I can draw the bounding boxes around the faces when I get a response.

My first milestone was pre-processing my dataset and getting it ready for training. The dataset I used came with a text file that showed where to place the bounding boxes. I wrote a small script that loops through the annotations text file and generates a xml file in the xml directory. I also wrote a few tests to make sure my code works after I make changes.
